# Prolog-Based Reasoning on Parking Violations

This project is an interactive **parking eligibility checker** for CSUF, powered by a Prolog reasoning engine and a simple web frontend.

Users answer a short sequence of questions and the system uses Prolog rules to decide when it can be a parking violation.

## 1. Requirements

- [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) (tested with 9.x)
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)

No Node, npm, or frameworks are required – the frontend is a plain HTML file.
